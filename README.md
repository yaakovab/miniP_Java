<h1>Project in java</h1>
<h2>3D render engine</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>In that project, we built a 3D render engine, which means that it takes coordinates of geometric shapes in the three-dimensional space as well as the location of a virtual camera 
  and some details about the material the shapes made of e.g. its shininess and it renders that scene into a real picture</p> 
  <h3>Details</h3>
<p>This project was made as part of my learning in JCT. It was done in collaboration with a partner and it was part of the goal of that project to experience using git tools.
</p> <p>It was developed in a methode of <strong>TDD or test driven design</strong> which means that before we started to write the code to resolve a problem we first thought 
about where the solution might not work. We used both unit tests and integration tests.</p>
<p>The project is divided into appropriate classes and sub-classes in the OOD (object-oriented design) way.</p>
